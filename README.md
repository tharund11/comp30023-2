This was my submission for Project 2. The task was to create a DNS Server that handles IPv6 requests using a Linux environment. There are two types of server implemented - a standard option and one which uses a cache. A log file for the server is also generated.

More information about the task is in the [specification](https://github.com/tharund11/comp30023-2/blob/main/project2.pdf).
